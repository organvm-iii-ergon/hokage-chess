## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX: Content Approval

**Use this to decide IF a video idea is worth producing**

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Genuine Stakes** (will lose be real?) | 25% | ___ | Underdog > Guaranteed Win |
| **Narrative Arc** (ki-sho-ten-ketsu shape?) | 20% | ___ | Has setup, twist, resolution? |
| **Uniqueness** (different from last 5 videos?) | 20% | ___ | Is this angle novel? |
| **Engagement Potential** (comments/shares?) | 20% | ___ | Will people react/discuss? |
| **Series Continuity** (connects to larger arc?) | 15% | ___ | Does it advance Road to X? |
| | **TOTAL** | ___ / 100 | **Threshold: 60+ = Approve** |

**Example Application**:
- Video: "I Lost to a 900 Rated Player (Here's Why)" 
  - Genuine Stakes: 5 (real loss to lower-rated opponent)
  - Narrative Arc: 4 (setback leading to analysis)
  - Uniqueness: 3 (loss videos are common)
  - Engagement: 5 (people LOVE underdog failures)
