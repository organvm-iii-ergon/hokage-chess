## 🎯 QUARTERLY TARGETS (Bare Minimum)

| Phase | Subs | Views/Mo | CTR | Action |
|-------|------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Q1** | 33→250 | 500+ | 5%+ | Optimize thumbnails |
| **Q2** | 250→1k | 3k+ | 6%+ | Introduce rivals |
| **Q3** | 1k→3.5k | 10k+ | 6%+ | First sponsorship |
| **Q4** | 3.5k→10k | 20k+ | 6%+ | Authority built |

## 🎬 VIDEO TITLE FORMULA (Copy & Paste)

```
✅ "I FINALLY Beat the Opening That Destroyed Me"
✅ "This 1600 Played Like a Grandmaster"
✅ "One Game Away From 1500 (and I Blundered)"

❌ "Road to 1500 | Episode 13"  [REMOVE THIS FORMAT]
❌ "Puzzle Climb #47"  [TOO VAGUE]
```

**Formula**: [EMOTION] + [STAKES] + [CONTEXT]

## 🔴 STOP SIGNS (Pause & Reassess)

```
⚠️ CTR drops below 3% for 2+ weeks
   → New thumbnail template problem

⚠️ Retention <40% at 30-second mark  
   → Hook/opening is broken

⚠️ Zero subscriber growth for 4+ weeks
   → Content or discoverability issue

⚠️ You feel burned out
   → Reduce upload frequency (rest > content)

ACTION: Take 1-week break, audit, retest with 5 new videos
```

---

## 👁️ MEASURE ONLY THESE (Ignore Everything Else)

1. **CTR** (Click-Through Rate) = clicks / impressions
   - Target: 5-8% (higher = great)
   
2. **Retention** at 30 seconds = viewers still watching
   - Target: 50%+ (higher = great)
   
3. **Subscriber growth** week-over-week
   - Target: +5-10/week in Q1
   
4. **Revenue** (if applicable)
   - Target: $0→$500+/mo by month 12

**Ignore**: Total views, likes, comments % (vanity metrics)

## 🎞️ NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (For Every Video)

Apply this 4-act pattern to each video:

```
0:00-0:10 (KI)      → Flashforward to dramatic moment
                       "Here's the position I almost lost"

0:10-3:00 (SHO)     → Build context & stakes
                       "My opponent has beaten me 3 times"

3:00-7:00 (TEN)     → The twist/critical moment
                       "But then they played this..."

7:00+ (KETSU)       → Resolution & reflection
                       "Here's what I learned"
```

## 🎯 DECISION TREE: Should I Make This Video?

```
Idea arrives → Ask:

1. "Will I ACTUALLY lose or struggle?"
   NO → Skip it (too predictable)
   YES → Continue

2. "Does it have a clear twist/reversal?"
   NO → Rework the concept
   YES → Continue

3. "Is this different from my last 5 videos?"
   NO → Different angle first
   YES → Continue

4. "Will people react/comment/discuss this?"
   NO → Needs hook rework
   YES → ✅ MAKE IT
